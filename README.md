# Early-Detection-Of-Autism
This is a student led project aimed at structure learning for the detection of autism. We have tried to learn baysian network given a dataset using different optimization techniques like Simulated Annealing and hill climbing. We were able to get an accuracy of more than 70% for the baysian networks we obtained.
